# FLight-Data-Delays-and-Cancelations-in-USA-2015---Data-Engineering-Capstone-Project
## This project was created for only study purposes.
Project Summary
A new airline wants to expand to the United States, so they want to learn about the state of US air traffic. so they decided to create a data model of canceled and delayed flight data at US airports under active airlines in 2015. The data provided by The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT).

This project uses data Data 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations, using ETL to convert the data into a dimensional model. Serves analysis of delayed flights and flight cancellation reasons. In this project, data will be reduced to the easiest model to analyze so that users can maximize the impact of the data on flight cancellations and delays.
